# Road Extraction from Satellite Images using DeepLabV3

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a deep learning model, specifically **DeepLabV3+**, to perform semantic segmentation on satellite images for road extraction. The goal is to detect and segment road regions from satellite images using a pre-trained model, achieving a high level of accuracy in identifying roads for various applications such as urban planning, autonomous vehicles, and environmental monitoring.

## Problem Statement

Urbanization is rapidly expanding, and the ability to map and monitor roads is crucial for various applications like transportation planning, disaster management, and autonomous driving. The task of road detection from satellite images is challenging due to variations in image quality, resolution, and environmental conditions. The objective of this project is to apply deep learning techniques to extract road features from satellite images, which can be used for further analysis and real-world applications.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of high-resolution satellite images with labeled road annotations. The dataset includes images from various geographical regions, which capture different types of roads in diverse environments. The goal is to train the **DeepLabV3+** model to segment roads accurately from these images.

### Dataset Source
- The dataset can be found on Kaggle or any other open-source data repository.
- The data includes both **images** and **labels** (segmentation masks) that are used for training and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

This project uses **DeepLabV3+**, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for semantic image segmentation. The model is built on a **ResNet-50** encoder, with **ImageNet** pretrained weights. DeepLabV3+ improves upon the original DeepLabV3 by adding a decoder module to refine object boundaries, making it suitable for tasks like road extraction.

Key components of the model:
- **Encoder**: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Decoder**: DeepLabV3+ architecture for refined segmentation
- **Activation Function**: Sigmoid (for binary segmentation)
